| Policy Not Adhered To                                 | Description of Violation                                                                                           | Workaround to Fix                                                                                  |

| Lack of Privacy Policy                                | Google AdSense requires a Privacy Policy page that clearly states the use of cookies and personal data collection for ads[1][2]. | Add a dedicated Privacy Policy page describing the use of cookies, user data, and ad personalization. |
| Low-Value or Thin Content                             | AdSense prohibits sites with little or irrelevant content (“low-value content”). Automated, scraped, or duplicate material may lead to violations[3][4]. | Remove thin, duplicate, or low-value pages. Add original, high-quality, and informative content that delivers value.   |
| Copyrighted or Replicated Content                     | Monetizing with AdSense on copied, scraped, or copyrighted material without rights is prohibited[5][4].            | Remove any copied content. Ensure all material is original or properly licensed with clear attribution.                  |
| Invalid Ad Placement / Deceptive Layouts              | Ads must not be placed close to navigation/button elements, nor should they mimic site features (menus, downloads)[6][7].           | Clearly distinguish ads from content. Keep adequate space between ads and site elements. Use permitted ad labels only.  |
| No EU User Consent (GDPR Compliance)                  | Sites serving users in the EU must ask for consent for cookies/ad personalization via a Certified CMP[1][2].         | Implement a Google-certified Consent Management Platform to collect user consent as per GDPR.                             |
| Excessive Ads “Above the Fold” and Poor User Experience | Ads must not outweigh genuine content, nor overly distract, confuse, or frustrate users[5][6].                      | Moderate ad placements: ensure ads complement content, not dominate pages. Follow Google’s guidelines for ad density and placement. |

**How to Proceed:**
- Address each issue by updating site structure, content, and policy pages.
- After fixing, request a review in the AdSense Policy Center.
- Maintain regular site audits for future compliance.
