## AdSense Program Policies: Compliance Checklist before Requesting Site Review

Use this checklist to ensure your website fully complies with Google AdSense Program Policies and is ready for validation and approval. Address each point before resubmitting your site for review.

### 1. Content Requirements

- **Unique, Original Content**: Every page showing ads must contain substantive, original content that provides value to visitors. Avoid duplicate, thin, or scraped material[1][2][3].
- **No Under Construction Pages**: Remove or complete any pages that are unfinished or marked “under construction”[4].
- **No Low Value Content**: Do not display ads on pages with little or no value, such as placeholder, thank you, login, or error pages[5][2][4].
- **Supported Language**: All monetized content must be in a Google-supported language[2].

### 2. Site Structure & User Experience

- **Well-Organized & Navigable**: The site should be easy to navigate; users should find information or services clearly and easily[3][6].
- **No Deceptive Navigation**: Menu, buttons, or other navigation elements must not be disguised as ads or vice versa; never use misleading links or labels[1].
- **No Ads on Functional Screens**: Ads must not appear on alert, navigation, or behavioral utility pages (e.g., calculators, alarms, flashlights)[4].

### 3. Ad Placement & Behavior

- **Clear Distinction Between Ads and Content**: Ads must be clearly recognizable. Only label ads as “Advertisements” or “Sponsored Links” — never use misleading labels like “Resources” or “Favorite Sites”[5].
- **No Artificial Clicks or Impressions**: Do not click your own ads or use tools to artificially generate traffic or clicks. No encouraging users to click or view ads, including incentives or deceptive calls-to-action[1][5].
- **No Images Next to Ads**: Do not place misleading images beside ads to attract attention[5].
- **No Ads in Non-Content Areas**: Do not display ads in pop-ups, pop-unders, emails, or software applications. Ads must not be on pages published solely for ads or where email/private messages are the page’s primary focus[1][5].

### 4. Traffic sources

- **Avoid Invalid Traffic**: No paid-to-click, autosurf, click-exchange programs, or unsolicited spam (including email blasts) to generate traffic for pages with ads[1].
- **Follow Webmaster Guidelines**: Your site must adhere to Google’s webmaster quality guidelines: avoid spammy tactics, keyword stuffing, and unnatural link schemes[6][7].

### 5. Other Technical and Policy Considerations

- **Mobile & App Implementation**: App developers monetizing via webviews must use approved implementation methods (e.g., WebView API for Ads for Android/iOS)[1].
- **Privacy Compliance**: Include a clear privacy policy, especially if gathering user data for personalized ads, and obtain user consent as required by law[8].
- **Frequent Policy Checks**: Policy updates occur; regularly review official AdSense/AdMob documentation to ensure ongoing compliance[1][5].
