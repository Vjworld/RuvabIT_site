That's an excellent question, and it's a critical part of the business proposition. The fee you can charge depends on a number of factors, including:

Your website's traffic and authority: The more visitors you get, and the higher your domain authority (DA) or domain rating (DR), the more you can reasonably charge. A site with a high DA is more valuable for SEO purposes.

The target audience: If your website's audience is highly targeted and relevant to the products you're promoting, that's a premium service. For example, if you have a niche blog for developers and a solution provider wants to promote a new API tool, the value is high.

The scope of the service: You're offering a package deal: a direct link placement AND a weekly blog post. This is more valuable than just a simple link or a single post.

Your costs: As you mentioned, the fee needs to cover your ongoing expenses (hosting, maintenance, etc.) and your time (writing the blog posts, managing the "Solutions" section).

What the market will bear: What are similar services charging? This can be difficult to research directly, but you can look at the cost of blog post sponsorships or backlink placements on similar websites to get a rough idea.

Potential Pricing Models and Fee Structures
Given your offer, here are a few ways you could structure your pricing, along with some typical ranges to consider. These are based on general industry averages and your specific value proposition:

1. Flat Monthly Fee
This is a simple and common model for this type of service.

What's included: The link in the "Solutions" section and one blog post per week (four per month).

Potential fee range: $50 - $250 USD per month.

$50 - $100: A good starting point if your site is new and has lower traffic. It's an affordable entry point for other founders and shows you're focused on building value first.

$100 - $250+: As your site's traffic and authority grow, you can increase this fee. This range is more typical for a site with established, consistent organic traffic.

2. Tiered Pricing
This allows you to offer different levels of service and gives the other founders a choice based on their budget.

Bronze Tier: Link placement only. This is your most basic offering.

Potential fee: $20 - $50 USD per month.

Silver Tier: Link placement + one blog post per month.

Potential fee: $50 - $150 USD per month.

Gold Tier: Link placement + one blog post per week (four per month) + social media promotion. This is your premium package.

Potential fee: $150 - $400+ USD per month.

3. Per-Post Fee
If you don't want to commit to a monthly retainer, you could charge for each blog post you write and publish.

What's included: One blog post highlighting their solution and a permanent link on your "Solutions" page.

Potential fee: $50 - $200+ USD per post.

$50 - $100: A solid price for a well-written, single blog post with link placement.

$100 - $200+: You can charge more if the post is long-form (1,500+ words), includes an in-depth review, or if your website has high authority.
